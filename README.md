Project description:
We were motivated to create a site for a diner where menus, meals, prices, pictures and description would be visible, able to be altered and customers could
select food or drinks to order in the invoice tab. Customers would only be able to see the meals for each mealtime after a successful login where they could then 
make their order. We were able to do this by seeding our database with the information for each menu and meal with MySQL and templating the page with Handlebars.js. 
We had routes set up for logging in, logging out as well as adding/finding meals by ID and confirming that a meal had been added to the invoice. The biggest challenge we had 
was just connecting everything from the routes to the handlebars to the JavaScript and getting the pages to display things the way we wanted to. It took a lot of 
trial and error as well as tooling around with different code in handlebars but we got it how we wanted it eventually. This project really pushed us to understand the material taught
from the last few weeks in ways that were really helpful, handlebars didn't come naturally to us but we worked together and figured it out as a team. 


Future development:
A lot can be done in future development as it can be synced up with food delivery companies such as Uber Eats and DoorDash. The invoice right now just shows what you've chosen to order and the price but another development could be to take credit card information with an application such as Stripe so that customers could pay on the site. A members only menu that displays after a successful login was something else that we discussed but ultimately moved away from in this stage. However, with future development that could be a fun perk for members to have.

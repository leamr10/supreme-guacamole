Project description:
We were motivated to create a site for a diner where menus, meals, prices, pictures and description would be visible, able to be altered and customers could
select food or drinks to order in the invoice tab. Customers would only be able to see the meals for each mealtime after a successful login where they could then 
make their order. We were able to do this by seeding our database with the information for each menu and meal with MySQL and templating the page with Handlebars.js. 
We had routes set up for logging in, logging out as well as adding/finding meals by ID and confirming that a meal had been added to the invoice.
